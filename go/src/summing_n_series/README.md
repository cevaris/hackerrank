Mandarin \| Russian \| Japanese

You are given a series, whose nth term is defined as

    Tn = n^2 - (n-1)^2

You have to find the Sum of the series Sn = T1 + T2 + T3 + .... + Tn

Find Sn % (10^9 + 7)

Input Format

First line contains an integer,T, denoting the number of testcases.
Each test case contains an integer n

Output Format

For each test case, print the required sum % (109 + 7)

Constraints

    1 <= T <= 10
    1 <= n <= 1016
