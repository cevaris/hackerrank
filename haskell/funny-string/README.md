# Funny String

### Problem Statement
Suppose you have a string S which has length N and is indexed from 0 to N−1. String R is the reverse of the string S. The string S is funny if the condition |Si−Si−1|=|Ri−Ri−1| is true for every i from 1 to N−1.

(Note: Given a string str, stri denotes the ascii value of the ith character (0-indexed) of str. |x| denotes the absolute value of an integer x)

### Input Format

First line of the input will contain an integer T. T testcases follow. Each of the next T lines contains one string S.

### Constraints

1<=T<=10
2<=length of S<=10000
Output Format

For each string, print Funny or Not Funny in separate lines.

### Sample Input

2
acxz
bcxz

### Sample Output

Funny
Not Funny

### Explanation

Consider the 1st testcase acxz

here

|c-a| = |x-z| = 2
|x-c| = |c-x| = 21
|z-x| = |a-c| = 2

Hence Funny.

Consider the 2st testcase bcxz

here

|c-b| != |x-z|
Hence Not Funny.
